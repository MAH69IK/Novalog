 - fix by Amigac to not skip the "command" line when "logdir" and "break" are
   both in use (#2401520)

   partially on work from cJ #1910360 and Philip White #1690349, and for

   Ingo Bormuth (Gentoo Bug #233794)

* Version 0.8-rc4
 - fix typo in previous change when checking the return of strftime()
   as reported by Mark Wagner.

* Version 0.8-rc3
 - use strftime() rather than printing out time values ourself so we get
   localization for free via the system libc and so we don't have to
   manipulate time structs ourselves (#1054478).

* Version 0.8-rc2
 - config file in package updated (pull fixes from Gentoo)
 - cleanup code a bit
 - make --help more [non-root] friendly
 - change default 'command spawn' messages to off (use --verbose to
   get back old noisy behavior)
 - check for setprogname() so we build on FreeBSD 6.1 (#1557585, fix
   from Diego Petteno)
 - fix error in memory allocation when using multiple facilities #1217560
 - queue up messages in signal handlers via a pipe so that we don't hit
   deadlocks by using functions that are unsafe for use inside these states

* Version 0.8-rc1
 - new keyword: break
 - config file in package updated (synch with break keyword)
 - kernel logging problem fix
 - race condition fix
 - novalog.conf man page added
 - log rotation can be disabled with maxsize or maxtime = 0

* Version 0.7
 - Logging is now synchronous by default. Use --async to get back to
   the asynchronous behavior.
 - Duplicate messages are now only logged once.
 - Negative regexes were implemented and programs can now also be
   matched against regexes. See the new neg_regex, program_regex and
   program_neg_regex keywords.
 - The maximum urgency can now be specified for each block. A new
   keyword, "maximum" completes "minimum".
 - A PID file is now created. It defaults to /var/run/novalog.pid but
   it can be changed with the --pidfile switch.
 - The location of the configuration file can now be changed with
   --with-configfile.
 - The code was cleaned up.

* Version 0.7-beta

   Hendrick Visage.

* Version 0.6
