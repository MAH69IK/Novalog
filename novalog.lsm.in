Title: novalog
Version: @VERSION@
Entered-date: 9 Jul 2001
Description: Novalog is a modern replacement for syslogd and klogd.
The logged messages can be dispatched according to their facility,
urgency, program name and/or Perl-compatible regular expressions. Log
files can be automatically rotated when they exceed a certain size or
age. External shell scripts (e.g., mail) can be launched when specific
patterns are found. Novalog is simple to configure, accepts unlimited
number of rules and has (switchable) memory bufferization for maximal
performance.
